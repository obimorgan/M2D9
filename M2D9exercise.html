        (If you want, you can also add extra columns)
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
        Add a DELETE bootstrap button at the end of each row of the tracklist.

        ## EXTRA CSS CHALLENGE ##
        Make only one button visible at a time, for each row, when the single row gets hovered. 
        Animate it with a fade-in effect upon the user hovering and fade-out when he/she goes away from it.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
        Add an "Add Track" button under the tracklist of the album. 
        It should have a nice shadow transition when its hovered (with the box-shadow property) 
        to look like as if the button was elevating itself.
    -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
        On the click of "Add Track" button, a modal should appear.
        (check in the documentation the modal + button example)
        
        The modal shall contain single input fields (avoid using a <form> to wrap the inputs) with:
        - Track number
        - Track title
        - Track duration

        The fields should be inside an Input Group and divided in 2 columns.
    -->

        - Close => closes the modal

        Alert the user with a success message when the track gets added, or when a track gets deleted.
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
        Considering the "Add Track" functionality that you've created on ex. 8: 
         - The new list-element added to the list should appear with a fade-in effect
     -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 11
        Considering the button you've created in ex. 5 that deletes the row:
        Add a fade-out effect to the row before it gets removed, using a CSS transition effect
    -->
